# DC-Car Handheld Tester

Firmware releases for the DC-Car handheld IR analyzer - an ESP32-P4 based
handheld (Waveshare ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-5, 5" 720x1280 portrait touch)
that captures DC-Car IR traffic live, decodes and names the codes on screen,
stores them in flash, replays them from an on-screen remote pad, and serves a
browser-based code editor over WiFi.

<!-- RELEASE:BEGIN -->
## Latest firmware: v0.2.55 (2026-08-20)

- Adaptive WiFi power save. The radio runs full speed while the device is in
  use - screen lit, web page open (its 5 s poll counts), or an update
  streaming - and drops to modem power save about a minute after the screen
  goes dark and the web server goes quiet. First web request against a
  sleeping radio is slow (that IS the wake-up signal); everything after runs
  at full speed. Transitions are verified and logged
  (`wifi power save -> ...`).

Download `dcc_ir_handheld.bin` from the [latest release](https://github.com/SmarttInc/DCC-Car-Tester/releases/latest), or on the handheld: **Settings > Firmware > CHECK ONLINE**.

## Updating a handheld

Three channels, pick whichever is closest to hand:

- **Over the air** - on the handheld: Settings > Firmware > CHECK ONLINE.
  It reads this repository's latest release and installs the `.bin` if it is
  newer than what is running.
- **From a browser** - open the handheld's web page (the IP is shown on the
  Settings tab), click the gear, and upload `dcc_ir_handheld.bin`.
- **From the SD card** - copy `dcc_ir_handheld.bin` onto the card, insert
  it, then Settings > Firmware > FROM SD CARD.

Every channel goes through the same safety path: the image header is
validated before a byte is flashed, the write goes to the inactive firmware
slot, and the boot switch happens only after the whole image verifies. A new
firmware that fails to start is rolled back automatically on the next power
cycle, and Settings > Advanced has a manual ROLL BACK button that boots the
previous firmware at any time - nothing is erased in either direction.

If this repository is private, a handheld needs its own fine-grained GitHub
token (Contents: read-only, this repository only) on the SD card as
`ota_token.txt` - it is imported once, then kept in the device's flash.

## What is in a release

- `dcc_ir_handheld.bin` - the plain ESP-IDF app image, exactly what every
  update channel expects. No merged binary, no bootloader, no partition
  table.
- The release notes are the matching section of the project's change log.

Development happens in the DCC-Cars repository alongside the rest of the
tool chain (vehicle decoder firmware, CV programmer, PC IR logger, and the
Arduino IR analyzer).
